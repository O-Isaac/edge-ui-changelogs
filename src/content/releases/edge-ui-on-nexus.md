### üçø New Features & Enhancements

- New FOMOD installer

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **What's included?**

- Includes all the addons and fixes from above + fixes that you guys reported (*TDM, SSLR, QuicklootIE, C.O.C.K.S, TrueHUD, SunHelm, CNO, MoreHUD, DBVO, Detection Meter etc)*
- Automatic **FOMOD** (thanks to Alaxouche)
- Covers both 16x9 and 21x9 resolution for both versions of the game
- AE version is **99% Unsquished** (*only skill menu screen for 21x9 is not covered, because it breaks as soon as I unsquish it, gotta investigate further*), **you don't need to use any unsquish fixes**

### üêûüö© **Known issues - don't report them**

- Skills menu on AE ultrawide being not fully unsquished
- MoreHUD widget still has that gold display bug - will probably just remade the widget from scratch, but have still included the previous version because of high demands
- Some of the Itemcards being miss-aligned + text on barter menu being miss-aligned - had no time to finish those up, and in case of the itemcards - I don't want to work on this version too much, because my **3D Itemcard** addon is in the process
- Survival addon miss-alignment - Wont cover it because I dont use it and as stated above, the itemcards are being completely remade
- Loading screen being garbage. Alax did include those versions, but they are outdated and only use them if for some reason you like them. New Loading Screens in the process

### üì¶ **Installation and requirements**

- For the non-addons version, you only need **skyui** installed, for addons: mods that you want to use the addon for + their requirements
- If you use the addons, **make sure that Edge UI overwrites the mods that are being reskinned especially DBVO and Experience**
- **Don't forget, 99% of the problems with the UI is due to something overwritting Edge UI, make sure that only mods that you need to take priority over Edge UI are overwriting my mod (Fonts, Aura Tweaks, Startmenu/Loading screen replacers etc)**
- Have fun, and don't forget to check [https://beta-edge-ui-docs.vercel.app/guides/skyhud](https://beta-edge-ui-docs.vercel.app/guides/skyhud) and [https://edge-ui-docs.vercel.app/documentation](https://edge-ui-docs.vercel.app/documentation) first, before asking questions
